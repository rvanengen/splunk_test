# Please make any changes to system defaults by overriding them in

# CAUTION:
#
#    - You can destroy Splunk's performance by editing literals.conf incorrectly.
#
#    - Only edit the attribute values (on the right-hand side of the '=').
#      DO NOT edit the attribute names (left-hand side of the '=').
#
#    - When strings contain "%s" (or %d, %ld, etc.), do not add or remove any
#      occurrences of %s, or reorder their positions.
#
#########################################################################
#
# The full name of a string resource is stanza_name + '_' + attribute
# name.  After a descriptive attribute name, append two underscores,
# and then use the letters after the % in printf formatting strings,
# surrounded by underscores.  For example "MSG_NAME__D_LU_S" would
# expect 3 args, a %d, %lu, and %s.
